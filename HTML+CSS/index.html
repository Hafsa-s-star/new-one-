    <p style="color:black; 5px;"><strong>A doctor in Pakistan typically takes around 5 to 6 years of undergraduate
            education (MBBS), followed by a house job/internship that lasts for a year. After that, individuals usually
            complete a residency program, which can take several more years depending on the specialization.Do you dream
            of becoming a general physician? With the rising number of patients, the country is in dire need of
            qualified doctors. Here is your guide on how to become a general physician in Pakistan.

            A general physician, also called a doctor, is a highly trained medical professional specializing in all
            forms of non-surgical treatments. They treat chronic or acute illnesses and provides a treatment and
            prevention plan. It is a profession that is held in high regard and honor by people from all walks of life.
            The doctors’ responsibility is to save lives, assist in the birth of new life, and give hope to the sick and
            distressed.

            There are numerous diseases and disorders that afflict this planet, and natural and artificial accidents
            (gunshots, car accidents), so different medical problems are handled by different types of doctors based on
            their specialization. Medicine is one of the most desirable professions in the world and one of the most
            financially rewarding. </strong></p>

    <p><strong>levels. This is necessary because universities and colleges that offer the MBBS degree only accept
            students who
            have completed this qualification. Because this is such a strong field in healthcare, the demand for this
            degree
            is usually quite high, so you should work hard and achieve a high score (at least 80%) during your
            intermediate
            studies.

            3. MDCAT Exam
            An MDCAT (medical and dental college admission test) is mandatory, especially in Punjab. Scoring at least
            80% is
            compulsory to qualify for applying to medical universities. Then, the admission is based on the merit lists
            of
            each university.

            4. Five Years of Medical College
            After the MDCAT comes the actual mountain to climb; five years of medical college! However intimidating that
            may
            sound, hundreds of students pass out from countless medical schools each year. Yet, medical studies require
            a
            lot of time and effort.5. One Year of House Job
            A House job is like an experience year for new graduates, and they step into the real world of hospitals and
            emergencies. Under close supervision and guidance of their seniors, fresh graduates follow the medical
            guidelines into becoming one of the frontline superheroes of the healthcare industry.

            6. Specialization Exams
            Those who want to specialize in a particular field such as gynecology, pediatrics, or surgery give a
            specialization exam.

            7. Work Experience
            In all areas of professional life, work experience is a must. The more experienced a doctor is, the more
            patients trust them. It is best to go out into the professional world as soon as possible to get every ounce
            of experience you can get.

    <p><em>In short, the stethoscope helps amplify internal body sounds from the heart, lungs, and bowls. Each internal
            sound
